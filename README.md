To replicate the figures and tables found in this paper, simply execute `main.py`. Provided all requirements are
satisfied, all figures and tables should be generated within the appropriate directories. Due to modifications made
during the journal's editorial process, there may be some small discrepancies between the newly generated items and
those in the published paper.

Below are some details on the contents of this repo.

* `main.py`: Execution script for all analysis.
* `data.csv`: Raw data in comma-separated value (CSV) format.
* `models/`: Results of the modeling. Contains all files except the MCMC posterior samples—those were too big for GitHub.

Please note that the analysis reported in this study relied upon Python and a number of third-party Python packages
that are maintained by unpaid developers. If you are reading this many years after the study was published, it is
possible that you will encounter errors. Questions related to such errors should be directed to the relevant
development teams. For science-related questions, feel free to contact me at `samuel dot mathias at childrens dot
